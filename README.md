# Go Puppy Go üê∂

Go Puppy Go is a web-based platform where users can browse different dog breeds and adopt puppies directly from registered owners. The system allows users to sign up, verify their emails, log in, and access a directory of puppies available for adoption. Owners can list puppies with mandatory adoption fees, and users can view breed information stored in the system.
